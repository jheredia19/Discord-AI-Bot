Discord AI Bot

I'll likely add more features to the bot as I continue developing my server.

Current Features:
Responds to Discord user messages using AI (OpenAI).

FAQ:
To use the bot, update your discord_token and openai_api_key in the config file.

You don't need to modify main_prompt, response_interval, or message_history_contextâ€”these are optional preference settings. However, you must configure target_channels, which determines where the AI bot will send messages. Simply copy your channel ID and paste it into this setting.

Let me know for any suggestions!
